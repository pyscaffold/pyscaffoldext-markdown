# pyscaffoldext-markdown

[PyScaffold] extension which replaces [reStructuredText] formatted files
by [Markdown] format except for [Sphinx]-related files.


## Usage

Just install this package with `pip install pyscaffoldext-markdown`
and note that `putup -h` shows a new option `--markdown`.
Basically this extension will replace `README.rst` by a proper `README.md` and
activate the support of Markdown files in Sphinx.


## Limitations

Due to limitations of the Markdown syntax compared to [reStructuredText],
it is necessary to use symbolic links (and some reStructuredText files) to
avoid keeping multiple copies of files (such as `CHANGELOG.md`) meant to be
placed at the root of the repository but included in the documentation
generated by [Sphinx]. If you are a Windows user please make sure to configure
your system accordingly. The following references might be helpful:

- [https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/pull/7739](https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/pull/7739)

Windows users that still face problems after configuring their systems for
symbolic links might want to attempt [WSL] or decide to stick with [reStructuredText]
for (problematic) parts of their documentation files.


## Building and Releasing

By default, the [tox] configuration generated by [PyScaffold] is compatible
with Markdown (as implemented in this extension). This means that (after
installing [tox] with [pip] or [pipx]) you can run:

```bash
tox -e docs  # to build your documentation
tox -e build  # to build your package distribution
tox -e publish  # to test your project uploads correctly in test.pypi.org
tox -e publish -- --repository pypi  # to release your package to PyPI
tox -av  # to list all the tasks available
```

Please remember that the command `python setup.py release` is no longer
recommended, so if you don't like [tox], please consider using
[Sphinx] and [twine] directly:

```bash
python -m pip install -U pip setuptools wheel sphinx twine
python setup.py bdist_wheel  # to build your package distributions
make -C docs html  # to build your docs
twine upload dist/*  # to release your package to PyPI
```

## Making Changes & Contributing

This project uses [pre-commit], please make sure to install it before making any
changes:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
cd pyscaffoldext-markdown
pre-commit install
```

It is a good idea to update the hooks to the latest version:

```bash
pre-commit autoupdate
```
