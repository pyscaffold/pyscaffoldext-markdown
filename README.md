# pyscaffoldext-markdown

PyScaffold extension which replaces [reStructuredText] formatted files
by [Markdown] format except for Sphinx-related files.

## Usage

Just install this package with `pip install pyscaffoldext-markdown`
and note that `putup -h` shows a new option `--markdown`.
Basically this extension will replace `README.rst` by a proper `README.md` and
activate the support of Markdown files in Sphinx.
Due to limitations of the Markdown syntax compared to reStructuredText,
the main documentation files still use reStructuredText by default.

Remember to install [wheel] version 0.31 or higher and use [twine] to upload your
package to [PyPI] instead of `python setup.py release` for this to work, e.g.:
```bash
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
twine upload dist/*
```
